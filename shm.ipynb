    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)** through theory, numerical simulation, and visualization. We investigate two core oscillatory systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Pendulum** — small-angle SHM and **large-amplitude** motion, where the period increases beyond $T_0=2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$ and is computed accurately using **elliptic integrals** (via `ellipk`).  \n",
    "2. **Mass–Spring–Damper System** — free oscillations across damping regimes (undamped, underdamped, critically damped, overdamped) and **driven damped motion** under sinusoidal forcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine analytical results where possible (e.g., undamped solutions and steady-state response concepts) with **4th-order Runge–Kutta (RK4)** integration for general damped/forced dynamics. The notebook emphasizes physical interpretation using **time-domain plots**, **phase-space portraits** $(x,v)$, and **energy diagnostics**:\n",
    "- conservative motion (closed loops, constant energy),\n",
    "- free damped decay (inward spirals, monotonic energy loss),\n",
    "- driven steady state (approach to limit cycles, bounded time-varying energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we study **resonance and frequency response** for driven systems, highlighting that:\n",
    "- **displacement (amplitude) resonance** peaks at a damping-dependent frequency $f_r=f_0\\sqrt{1-2\\zeta^2}$ (only if $\\zeta<1/\\sqrt{2}$),\n",
    "- while **velocity** and **power (energy-transfer)** peaks occur at the **natural frequency** $f_0$ for all damping cases.\n"

    "  - The simulation is ideal: no damping or driving forces included, so energy is effectively conserved.\n",
    "  - Important approximation: the angular motion uses a cosine form (linear solution) but with the corrected period. For large amplitudes this is only an approximation; a full nonlinear solution requires solving the ODE (e.g. numerical integration with `solve_ivp`) or using elliptic-integral expressions for exact phase evolution.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Case 1: $f_d<f_r$ (below resonance)**\n",
    "  - The system can “follow” the drive more easily (quasi‑static behavior as you go very low in frequency).\n",
    "  - Displacement amplitude is typically **smaller than the peak**, and the phase lag $\\phi$ is **small** (response closer to in‑phase with force).\n",
    "  - Phase space: after transients, you get a **limit-cycle ellipse** with smaller size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 2: $f_d=f_r$ (at displacement resonance)**\n",
    "  - This is where **displacement amplitude $A(\\omega)$ is maximum** for that damping value.\n",
    "  - Physically: the timing of the drive aligns best with the oscillator’s natural tendency to oscillate, so energy input per cycle is most effective at producing large displacement (while damping still keeps it finite).\n",

    "- **Case 3: $f_d>f_r$ (above resonance)**\n",
    "  - The mass can’t keep up with the rapidly oscillating force; inertia dominates.\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- For large pendulum amplitudes, the period increases beyond the small-angle approximation $T_0 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$; elliptic-integral corrections (via ellipk) quantify this increase.\n",
    "- Damping fundamentally changes system behavior:\n",
    "    - Underdamped systems oscillate with exponentially decreasing amplitude (inward spirals in phase space).\n",
    "    - Critically damped systems return fastest to equilibrium without overshoot.\n",
    "    - Overdamped systems return slowly without oscillation.\n",
    "- The RK4 method provides excellent accuracy and stability for simulating nonlinear oscillatory systems over moderate time horizons.\n",
    "- Phase space plots reveal the nature of energy dissipation: closed loops for conservative systems, spirals (stable focus) for underdamped free decay, and approach to driven limit cycles for forced steady state.\n",
    "- Energy evolution diagnostics show constant total mechanical energy for undamped SHM, monotonic decay for free damped motion, and time-varying but bounded energy in driven steady state (with average input power balancing dissipation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional: damped driven oscillation and resonance\n",
    "- Damped, driven systems exhibit a steady‑state oscillation whose amplitude depends on driving frequency and damping. Transients (homogeneous solution) decay, leaving a periodic particular solution at the drive frequency.\n",
    "- Displacement (amplitude) resonance:\n",
    "    - Peak amplitude occurs at $\\omega_r=\\omega_0\\sqrt{1-2\\zeta^2}$ and exists only if $\\zeta<1/\\sqrt{2}$ (i.e., sufficiently light damping).\n",
    "    - The resonant frequency and peak amplitude both depend on damping.\n",
    "- Velocity resonance:\n",
    "    - The steady‑state velocity amplitude $A_v(\\omega)=\\omega A(\\omega)$ peaks at the natural frequency $\\omega_0$ for all damping values (peak location independent of $\\zeta$).\n",
    "- Energy / power resonance:\n",
    "    - Average input power $\\langle P\\rangle=\\langle Fv\\rangle$ (and average dissipated power $\\langle c v^2\\rangle$) peaks at $\\omega_0$ for damped systems; energy transfer efficiency is maximal at the natural frequency.\n",
    "- Practical comparison (amplitude vs velocity vs energy):\n",
    "    - Amplitude resonance: depends on damping, may shift below $\\omega_0$ and vanish if damping is large.\n",
    "    - Velocity & power peaks: robustly occur at $\\omega_0$ regardless of damping, so measures based on velocity or dissipated power identify the same characteristic frequency.\n",
    "- Phase space & energy evolution plots:\n",
    "    - Free undamped: closed ellipses (constant energy).\n",
    "    - Free damped: inward spirals to the origin; energy decays monotonically ($\\dot E = -c v^2$).\n",
    "    - Driven damped: trajectories spiral onto a limit-cycle ellipse at the drive frequency; energy oscillates each cycle while the cycle-average energy is constant in steady state.\n"
